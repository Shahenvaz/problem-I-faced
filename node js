PROBLEM :nodemon : File C:\Users\ABU HAMZA\AppData\Roaming\npm\nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on 
this system

Salution:
Open Windows PowerShell with Run As Administrator.
Type Get-ExecutionPolicy
After pressing enter I see Restricted.
Now type 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Atlast type Get-ExecutionPolicy 
it will change to unristricted.
so and again run nodemon filename it will work
